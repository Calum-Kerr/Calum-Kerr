## About Me

I'm a student at Edinburgh Napier University, working on projects that blend practical tools with engaging experiences.

## Projects

### RevisePDF

- [RevisePDF](https://www.revisepdf.com/): A web app for manipulating PDFs. Here's what you can do with it:
  - **PDF to Image**: Turn PDFs into images like JPEG.
  - **Panoramic Images**: Combine PDF pages into one big image.
  - **Compress PDFs**: Shrink PDF files without losing too much quality. Still tweaking this feature.
  - **Export to Other Formats**: Convert PDFs to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Working on improving this functionality.

### 2D Soulsborne Inspired RPG Game

I'm currently developing a **2D side scrolling RPG game** loosely based on Soulsborne games. Here's what to expect:

- **Challenging Combat**: Adding mechanics like stamina management, dodging, and strategic attacks to create engaging and difficult battles.
- **Rich Environments**: Dark and gothic aesthetics with hidden shortcuts, and secrets to discover.
- **Character Progression**: Upgradeable stats, weapons, and abilities to enhance gameplay and provide a sense of growth.
- **Deep Lore**: An immersive storyline told through environmental storytelling and item descriptions, encouraging exploration and discovery.
- **Development Tools**: Built using C++ and SFML, focusing on robust game mechanics and smooth gameplay.
