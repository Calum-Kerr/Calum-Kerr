# Hi there, I'm Calum Kerr ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a student at Edinburgh Napier University, currently working on a PDF manipulation project. I like building practical tools that solve real problems.

## Projects

### SnackPDF
- [SnackPDF](https://www.snackpdf.com/): A web app for messing around with PDFs. Here's what you can do with it:
  - **PDF to Image**: Turn PDFs into images like JPEG.
  - **Panoramic Images**: Combine PDF pages into one big image.
  - **Compress PDFs**: Shrink PDF files without losing too much quality. Still tweaking this feature.
  - **Export to Other Formats**: Convert PDFs to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Working on making this better.

## Learning and Growth

- I'm diving deeper into web development, especially focusing on Python, HTML/CSS, and backend stuff.
- Experimenting with deploying apps on Heroku and managing databases for better performance.
